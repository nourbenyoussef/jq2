                    I'm a puppet on a string

                        Could a shaped heartaches
                        Come to find ya fall in some velvet morning
                        Years too late
                        She's a silver lining lone ranger riding
                        Through an open space
                        In my mind when she's not right there beside me
                        I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
                        And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
                        And I can't help myself
                        All I wanna hear her say is are you mine?
